## Steps:

1. - [x] Create a maze in the form of a matrix of N. For example a matrix of 4 is a table, or grid of 4 rows and 4 columns.

2. - [x] Set every cell to either 1, meaning free/walkable, or 0, meaning blocked. The starting point is always the top left of the maze, with coordinates i=0 and j=0. The destination is always the bottom right of the maze, with coordinates i=length of the maze - 1 and j=length of the maze - 1

3. - [x] set starting and finishing cell to 1
